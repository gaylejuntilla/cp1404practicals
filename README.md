# CP1404 Practicals

### Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## Summary:

Hi I'm Gayle and I'm a Bachelor of Science student. This is my repository which contains
my practical work of material learned in the programming subject CP1404.

## Clean Code

These are some of the main things I picked up along the way about clean code:

- Uses best practise (The right tool for the job)
- If main() looks too big it probably is, and you should look at making another function
- You can use the pylint module to check how "good" your code is
- Always look at alternative ways if you find yourself repeating certain code (DRY)
