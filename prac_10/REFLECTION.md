## Reflection


### Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?

My accuracy was quite good for the practical tasks since I took the humbling approach and gave myself a very lenient 
estimated time and well, it was definitely humbling!

### regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

At the start I was quite nervous about doing code reviews because I felt I didn't have much useful information to give
since I'm not experienced in coding, so I took many days to do a single code review and gave it too much thought. But
as I got more comfortable with concepts and less worried about how people would react to my advice, code reviews just became
another part of the prac rather than something to stress over. And I've seen quite a few techniques that I wouldn't have
thought of doing but would definitely use. Also, my reviewers are very encouraging which is much appreciated!

### regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

As a student I would say the amount of tasks (just kidding....(not actually)). But even though the pracs are very thorough
a few exercises, usually the smaller ones, I find to be spending too much time on since I get confused about what they're
asking for. And It's not a big deal to me, I don't mind it actually (as a student) but out of the 5? code reviews we had I think I received
2 which is still a win but maybe tweaking certain things there for more participation?
